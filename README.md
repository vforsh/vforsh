### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vlad and I am a game developer with 12 years of professional experience building 2d web and mobile
games. During my career I've participated in a creation of more than 40 games both as a
software engineer and as a project manager. My primary speciality is programming but Iâ€™m also
closely familiar with other aspects of game development such as game design, assets
optimization, and QA.

I enjoy creating performant and visually appealing web games. Also I'm a huge proponent of
improving developer experience. I often spend inexcusable amount of time creating some
scripts and tools for automation.
