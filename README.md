### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vlad and I am a game developer with 12 years of professional experience in building 2d web and mobile
games. Throughout my career, I have participated in the creation of over 20 games, both as a software engineer and as a project manager.

I enjoy creating performant and visually appealing web games, as well as exploring web development tooling and helping other engineers to be more productive by improving their Developer Experience. I often spend an inexcusable amount of time creating scripts and tools for automation.
